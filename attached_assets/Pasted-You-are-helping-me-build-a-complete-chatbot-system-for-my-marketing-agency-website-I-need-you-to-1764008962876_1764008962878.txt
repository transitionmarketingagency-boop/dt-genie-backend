You are helping me build a complete chatbot system for my marketing agency website.

I need you to generate a **full Node.js application** that provides:

1) A backend API endpoint:  
   POST /chat  
   - Receives: { message, sessionId }  
   - Calls a HuggingFace inference endpoint using my HF API key  
   - Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (free tier)  
   - Sends the LLM reply back as JSON  
   - Maintains simple session history in memory  
   - Uses express, cors, axios, dotenv  

2) A chatbot widget frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript) that I can paste into my website.  
   Requirements:  
   - Floating chat icon at bottom-right  
   - When clicked, opens a small chat window  
   - Sends user messages to the backend /chat endpoint  
   - Displays LLM responses  
   - Clean UI, small bubble style  
   - No frameworks, pure vanilla JS + CSS  

3) Training instructions (“system prompt”) inside the backend.  
   Use this personality and knowledge:

4) Include a clear README that tells me:
   - Where to paste my HuggingFace API key  
   - Which file contains the system prompt  
   - How to copy the chatbot widget code into my Framer website  
   - How to run/test the server  
   - How to change colors, icon, fonts  

5) All code must be **completely free** to run:
   - Use only free HuggingFace Inference API  
   - No paid libraries  
   - No paid hosting  
   - Should run perfectly on Replit free tier  
   - Chat widget should work on any website (Framer, HTML, WordPress, etc.)

6) Folder Structure:
   /backend  
      index.js  
      package.json  
      .env.example  
   /frontend  
      widget.html (floating chat widget)  
   /README.md

7) I want the app to:  
   - Start with “npm start”  
   - Auto-enable CORS  
   - Use PORT=8080 by default  
   - Return helpful errors if HuggingFace fails  

Please generate the full codebase now with all files and full content.
